# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the project:

In this project, we use Deep Machine Learning and Neural Networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, we received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

-	EIN and NAME—Identification columns
-	APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
-	AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
-	CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
-	USE_CASE—Use case for funding
-	ORGANIZATION—Organization type
-	STATUS—Active status
-	INCOME_AMT—Income classification
-	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
-	ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
-	IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively


This project consists of three technical analysis deliverables to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations:

- Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Optimize the Model
